This project and creation of code was done soley by Jheovanny Camacho (109697217).
This folder should contain four files:

The header (Array.h) and implemention (Array.cpp) files are part of the Array class.
The main cpp file is CSCI 115 Project 1.cpp which contains the main function and uses the Array class for its array functions.
